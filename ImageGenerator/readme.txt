A simple image generator by DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversial Network), implemented with Tensorflow.
1. run train.py to train the network given images under ./images. (Size: 64 x 64 x 3)
2. run generator.py to generate pictures under ./generated_images.
3. Pre-trained parameter file generator_weight is given, which can generate flowers (not very beautiful though).
